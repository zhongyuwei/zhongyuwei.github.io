I'm from Chengdu, Sichuan, China. I once dreamed of becoming a pianist when I was small -- I loved various kinds of music, from classical European music to contemporary African music and pop, they all seem so attractive to me. I planned to learn more about fine arts, philosophy and psychology in the future: though I know little about them now, I still have a lifelong time to study!

I met Olympic Informatics at 13. I regarded it as an important tool for viewing things in another perspective, and its interesting logics attracted me too.
